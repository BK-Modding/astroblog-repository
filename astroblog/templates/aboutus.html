Welcome to our blog which is a literary embodiment of the above quote. Except our thoughts are quite literally the stars that probably are a part of a constellation or at least a star cluster. 
<br>
<br>
The blog was developed by wannabe astrophysicists with the aim of creating a space for people with a deep-interest in space so that they can ponder over the mysteries of the cosmos and geek about the gravitational wave dance. <em>*insert stuff you can do*.</em>
I solemnly swear that we’re punny and we deliver great content which is moderated by amazing people to ensure that there are no trolls.</p>
